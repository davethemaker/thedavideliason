#[The David Eliason](http://www.thedavideliason.com)

Personal website for David Eliason, where I share about what I'm passionate about, what has been some of my biggest influences for the work I have accomplished (as well as what I wish to in the future), and other aspects to give a sense of who I am.

## Getting Started

You can view the source code on GitHub, or clone the repo to your local machine for exploring the code. There is no database connectivity, so after the repository is locally-situated, you can simply navigate your browser to the index.html file to open the site.

## Prerequisites

This site stresses simplicity in order to promote creative feature and portfolio expansion.

## Technologies Used:

 Skeleton version 2.0.4, HTML, CSS, FontAwesome, GoogleFonts

###Updates: v1.0 Skeleton -> v2.0 Bootstrap; v2.0 streamlined repositories
